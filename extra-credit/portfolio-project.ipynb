All code that you submit as part of this project should use the skills that you learned in this class, i.e., we will not accept projects written using Pandas or advanced Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project is really well-written, we will consider adapting it into a lab format in future iterations of this course (this acknowledgment could later be added to your portfolio). Do not hesitate to contact the instructor for feedback on your notebook, before you submit it.\n",
