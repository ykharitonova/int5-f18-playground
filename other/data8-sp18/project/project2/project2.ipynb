    "\n",
    "Welcome to Project 2!  You will investigate the relationship between murder and capital punishment (the death penalty) in the United States.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test whether observed data appears to be a random sample from a distribution\n",
    "2. Analyze a natural experiment\n",
    "3. Implement and interpret a sign test\n",
    "4. Create a function to run a general hypothesis test\n",
    "5. Analyze visualizations and draw conclusions from them\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday 4/6. You can earn an early submission bonus point by submitting your completed project by Thursday 4/5. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also **complete Parts 1 and 2 of the project (out of 5) and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 3/23**. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp18/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Punishment for crime has many [philosophical justifications](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/#ThePun).  An important one is that fear of punishment may *deter* people from committing crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute some people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, such as murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question about deterrence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Through our exploration, does instituting a death penalty for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a road map for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 1, we'll investigate the main dataset we'll be using.\n",
    "2. In section 2, we'll see how to test null hypotheses such as this: \"For this set of U.S. states, the murder rate was equally likely to go up or down each year.\"\n",
    "3. In section 3, we'll apply a similar test to see whether U.S. states that suddenly ended or reinstituted the death penalty were more likely to see murder rates increase than decrease.\n",
    "4. In section 4, we'll run some more tests to further claims we had been developing in previous sections. \n",
    "5. In section 5, we'll try to answer our question about deterrence using a visualization rather than a formal hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data source for this project comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crimes are committed by people, not states, we need to account for the number of people in each state when we're looking at state-level data.  Murder rates are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{murder rate for state X in year Y} = \\frac{\\text{number of murders in state X in year Y}}{\\text{population in state X in year Y}}*100000$$\n",
    "\n",
